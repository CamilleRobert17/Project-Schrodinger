# Why this project ?

This project aims to study the numerical solutions to the one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation for a single particle in different potentials. 

The wave function was propagated for different values of the bound-state energies with the Numerov algorithm, an iterative integration scheme until the appropriate boundary conditions were satisfied. An analytical test was first performed for the so-called "particle in a box" problem. The eigenvalues for the energies of the square well potential and the harmonic potential were then computed numerically.

The collaboration was done between Linda Muller and Camille Robert in the context of the course "Programming and Numerical Simulations" taught by Professor C. Boily at the Faculty of Physics and Engineering of the University of Strasbourg.
